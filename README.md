# TSV-TAS
A program that allows you to write TASes using a spreadsheet and then convert them to the TAS script file format

TSV-TAS requires Java to run. If TSV-TAS does not run with the Java SE installed, try installing the Java Development Kit, which you can find [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html).
